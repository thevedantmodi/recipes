Notes:

    This can be challenging by virtue of how many ingredients are required.
    I really like to eat this, so I am willing to go through the trouble.

Ingredients:
    Pressure cooker
    Water

    Toor Dal

    Tamarind

    Veggies (variable)

Steps:

    Cooking the dal
    
    1. Soak for 30 mins (optional)
    2. Rinse 1/2 cup toor dal four times.
    3. Drain water
    4. Pressure cook for 4 whistles with 3x water (so 3/2 cup water)

    Preparing the vegetables

    2. Place tamarind in water 
    3. Chop up 1/4 - 1/2 cup onion

    3. Pinch of Methi
    4. Pinch of Rai
